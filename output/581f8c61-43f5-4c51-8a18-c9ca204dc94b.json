    "Frequent job changes (avg tenure < 1 year)",
    "No certifications or evidence of continuous learning (e.g., ISTQB, Agile/Scrum)",
    "Underqualification in technical skills (missing automation testing, Selenium, Postman, and advanced SQL)",

  "growth_signals": [
    "Recent graduate with foundational QA knowledge (SDLC, STLC, JIRA, manual testing)",

  "recruiter_confidence": "Low",
  "selection_reason": "Priya Sharma demonstrates foundational QA skills and aligns with the minimum experience requirement (1 year). However, she lacks key technical skills like automation testing, Selenium, Postman, and advanced SQL, which are critical for the role. Additionally, there is no evidence of certifications or continuous learning, which raises concerns about her ability to quickly adapt to the technical demands of the position. While she shows potential for growth, the lack of soft skills and limited professional experience make her a partial fit for the role. With additional training and mentorship, she could grow into the position, but she is not an ideal candidate for immediate contribution.",
