  "selection_reason": "While Abhijit Bomble demonstrates strong technical expertise in AI/ML and software engineering, his skillset and experience do not align with the requirements of the Application Testing Engineer role. The job demands hands-on experience with testing tools (e.g., Selenium, JIRA, Postman) and processes (e.g., SDLC, STLC, defect life cycle), which are absent from his resume. Additionally, his career trajectory and projects suggest a focus on AI/ML development rather than application testing, raising concerns about long-term interest and fit for this role. Despite his strong growth signals and technical depth, the mismatch in core skills and experience makes him unsuitable for this position.",
