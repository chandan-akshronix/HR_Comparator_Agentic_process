    "Limited technical skills (missing automation testing, Selenium, Postman, CI/CD pipelines)",
    "No certifications (e.g., ISTQB) to validate testing knowledge",

    "Recent graduate with foundational QA knowledge (SDLC, STLC, JIRA, SQL basics)",

  "recruiter_confidence": "Low",
  "selection_reason": "Priya Sharma demonstrates foundational QA skills and has relevant experience in manual testing and defect tracking, which partially aligns with the job requirements. However, she lacks key technical skills like automation testing, Selenium, and Postman, which are critical for the role. Additionally, the absence of certifications or projects showcasing advanced testing knowledge raises concerns about her readiness for the position. While she shows potential for growth, the current skill gap and limited experience make her a partial fit for the role. With additional training and mentorship, she could grow into a stronger candidate.",
