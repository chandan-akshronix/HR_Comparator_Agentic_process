  "selection_reason": "The candidate, Priya Sharma, has relevant foundational skills such as manual testing, defect tracking (JIRA), SQL basics, and knowledge of SDLC and STLC. However, she lacks experience in automation testing tools (e.g., Selenium, TestNG, Cypress, Postman) and has no certifications like ISTQB, which is preferred. Additionally, her experience is limited to an internship, which may not fully meet the 1\u20135 years of experience requirement. While she demonstrates potential, further training and experience would be needed to fully align with the job requirements.",
