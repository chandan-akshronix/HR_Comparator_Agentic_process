  "selection_reason": "Priya Sharma demonstrates foundational QA skills and relevant experience as a QA Intern, aligning partially with the job requirements. However, she lacks key technical skills like automation testing, Selenium, Postman, and advanced SQL, which are critical for the role. Additionally, the absence of certifications, soft skills, and professional projects raises concerns about her readiness for a full-time role. While she shows potential for growth, significant training and mentorship would be required to bridge the skill gaps. Her fit is partial, and she may be considered for entry-level roles or internships with a focus on skill development.",
