  "selection_reason": "While Abhijit Bomble demonstrates strong technical expertise in AI/ML and software engineering, his skillset and experience do not align with the requirements of the Application Testing Engineer role. The job demands hands-on experience with testing tools (e.g., Selenium, JIRA, Postman) and methodologies (SDLC, STLC, defect life cycle), which are absent in the resume. Additionally, his career trajectory and projects indicate a focus on AI/ML, making it unlikely that he would be interested in or satisfied with a testing-focused role. While his growth signals are strong, they are not relevant to the specific needs of this position. Therefore, he is not a fit for this role.",
