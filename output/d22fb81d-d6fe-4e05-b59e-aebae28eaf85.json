  "selection_reason": "The candidate, Priya Sharma, has relevant foundational skills such as manual testing, defect tracking, SDLC, STLC, and test case design, which align with the job requirements. However, she lacks experience in automation testing tools like Selenium, TestNG, or Cypress, as well as advanced SQL knowledge. Additionally, her experience is limited to an internship, which may not fully meet the 1\u20135 years of experience requirement. The absence of certifications like ISTQB is another gap. While she demonstrates potential, further training and experience would be needed to fully meet the role's expectations.",
