  "selection_reason": "Ankit Verma is a strong candidate for the Application Testing Engineer role. He meets all the technical skill requirements, including manual and automation testing, Selenium, JIRA, Postman, and SQL queries. His experience aligns well with the job description, as he has 3 years of relevant experience in application testing, including functional, regression, and API testing. His ISTQB certification adds credibility to his testing expertise, and his exposure to Agile/Scrum and CI/CD pipelines is a bonus. While the resume lacks explicit mention of soft skills, his responsibilities in previous roles suggest collaboration and problem-solving abilities. The only minor risk is the lack of clarity on his current location, which could pose a relocation challenge. Overall, he demonstrates strong technical competence, relevant experience, and growth potential, making him a best fit for the role.",
