  "selection_reason": "Ankit Verma is a strong match for the Application Testing Engineer role. He possesses all the must-have technical skills, including manual and automation testing, Selenium, JIRA, Postman, and SQL queries. His 3 years of experience align well with the required range (1-5 years), and his domain experience in web and mobile application testing is directly relevant to the job description. The ISTQB certification adds credibility to his testing expertise, and his exposure to Agile/Scrum and CI/CD pipelines is a bonus. While there is a slight concern about his relatively short tenure at previous roles, his consistent career progression and relevant skill set mitigate this risk. Overall, he demonstrates the technical competence, domain alignment, and growth potential needed for the role.",
