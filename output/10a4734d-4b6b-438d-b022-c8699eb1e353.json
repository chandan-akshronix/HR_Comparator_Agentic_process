  "recruiter_confidence": "Low",
  "selection_reason": "Priya Sharma demonstrates foundational QA skills and aligns with some core job requirements, such as manual testing, defect tracking, and SDLC/STLC knowledge. However, she lacks critical technical skills like automation testing, Selenium, and Postman, which are must-haves for the role. Additionally, her experience is limited to an internship, and there is no evidence of certifications or continuous learning to bridge the skill gap. While she shows potential for growth, the current skill and experience gaps pose a risk for immediate job readiness. With proper training and mentorship, she could grow into the role, but she is not an ideal fit for immediate hiring.",
