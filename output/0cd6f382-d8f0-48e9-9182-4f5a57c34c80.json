  "selection_reason": "The candidate, Abhijit Bomble, has extensive experience and skills in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science, which do not align with the requirements for the Application Testing Engineer role. The job description emphasizes skills in manual and automation testing, tools like Selenium, TestNG, and JIRA, and knowledge of SDLC/STLC, which are not present in the candidate's resume. While the candidate has experience with SQL and regression (which are tangentially related), the core testing skills and certifications like ISTQB are missing.",
