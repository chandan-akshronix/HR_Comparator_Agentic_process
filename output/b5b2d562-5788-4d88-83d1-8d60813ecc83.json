  "recruiter_confidence": "Low",
  "selection_reason": "Priya Sharma demonstrates foundational knowledge in manual testing, defect tracking, and SDLC/STLC, which aligns with the job's basic requirements. However, she lacks experience in automation testing (Selenium, Postman) and has no certifications or significant project work to validate her skills. Her 1-year internship provides some relevant experience, but it is limited to manual testing without exposure to advanced tools or methodologies like CI/CD or Agile. While she shows potential for growth, the lack of demonstrated soft skills and technical depth poses a moderate risk. With proper training, she could grow into the role, but she is not an immediate best fit for the position.",
