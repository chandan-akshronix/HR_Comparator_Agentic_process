    "Limited technical skills (missing automation testing, Selenium, Postman, advanced SQL)",
    "No certifications (e.g., ISTQB) to validate testing knowledge",

  "recruiter_confidence": "Low",
  "selection_reason": "Priya Sharma demonstrates foundational QA skills such as manual testing, defect tracking, and familiarity with SDLC/STLC, which align partially with the job requirements. However, she lacks critical technical skills like automation testing, Selenium, and Postman, which are must-haves for the role. Additionally, her experience is limited to an internship, and there is no evidence of certifications or advanced projects to validate her expertise. While she shows potential for growth, the current skill gap and lack of experience in automation testing pose a risk. With proper training and mentorship, she could grow into the role, but she is not an immediate best fit for the position.",
