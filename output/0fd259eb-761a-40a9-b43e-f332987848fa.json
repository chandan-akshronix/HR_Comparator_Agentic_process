  "selection_reason": "Ankit Verma is a strong match for the Application Testing Engineer role. He possesses all the must-have technical skills, including manual and automation testing, Selenium, JIRA, Postman, and SQL queries. His 3 years of experience in application testing aligns well with the job's requirements, and his ISTQB certification adds credibility to his expertise. While soft skills are not explicitly mentioned, his work in Agile teams and defect resolution suggests problem-solving and collaboration abilities. The only minor risks are the lack of explicit soft skill documentation and unspecified current location, but these are outweighed by his technical competence and growth potential. Overall, he is a reliable and capable candidate for the role.",
